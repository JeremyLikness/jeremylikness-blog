At <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> [Build 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHg7uB3_amVXvaRgxIcXLtYD) I had the opportunity to present a short theater session focused on Azure Cosmos DB. I decided to divide the presentation into two parts. The first is an overview of relational databases and how they relate (see what I did there?) to non-relational or NoSQL databases. The second part demonstrates how Azure Cosmos DB provides a fully managed implementation of NoSQL that supports multiple APIs.

I demoed two projects as part of the talk. The full USDA database example implemented with the Mongo DB API is available here:

The flights example leveraging the Gremlin Graph API and the SQL API is available here:

You can download the full deck by [clicking here](https://jlikme.blob.core.windows.net/presentations/THR3511_Likness.pptx). One topic I was not able to cover in detail is consistency levels. This can be confusing to developers who havenâ€™t worked with distributed non-relational databases, so I wrote a blog post to help explain consistency levels using the analogy of a billiards tournament.

If you like what you see and want to dig deeper, be sure to check out the recap from my [full hour presentation](/dotnext-piter-2018-recap-91fbd02c67fa#a219) at the DotNext conference. You can download the larger deck that has more explanations and details, as well as watch that presentation once the video becomes publicly available.
