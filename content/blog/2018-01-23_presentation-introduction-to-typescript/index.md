Last night, I kicked off 2018 with my [first talk](https://www.meetup.com/AtlantaJavaScript/events/245257740/) of the year for the [Atlanta JavaScript Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/AtlantaJavaScript). This is a great group I‚Äôve been involved with for several years now. I named the talk ‚ÄúIntroduction to TypeScript (for JavaScript Developers).‚Äù

Special thanks to [Women who Code Atlanta](https://www.womenwhocode.com/atl) for choosing this talk as their first field trip!

Scores of enthusiastic developers braved rain and Atlanta traffic to attend the talk.

As with most my of my talks ([Conferences - Collection](https://kuula.co/explore/collection/7fy4R)), I asked for a little audience partition to create a 360 degree photo. Here is the [Creative Circus venue](https://creativecircus.edu/) in full three-dimensional surround.

Because my camera was mounted a little low, here is another perspective.

I started with a brief exercise around the nuances of JavaScript, looking at expressions that evaluate to ‚Ä¶ [WAT?!](https://jeremylikness.github.io/intro-to-typescript/presentation/intrototypescript.html#/3) You can click the button to evaluate the expression and puzzle over the results.

I talked briefly about the evolution of JavaScript over time.

The presentation includes examples across a variety of TypeScript features. It was fun to show, for example, how constructs like `class`, `let`, and the _spread operator_ (`‚Ä¶`) compile to legacy code for older versions of JavaScript but ‚Äúpass through‚Äù unchanged when the target is ECMAScript 2015. I also added some sections with advanced features, such as how to <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [build and apply decorators](https://github.com/JeremyLikness/intro-to-typescript/blob/master/samples/008-decorators.ts).

If you haven‚Äôt had the chance to review some of the latest features, they are pretty amazing. For example, did you know you can apply value constraints to variables? Take a look at the following code:

{{<highlight TypeScript>}}
type Awesomeness = "Low" | "Medium" | "High";

interface Advocate {
    name: string;
    twitter: string;
    awesome: Awesomeness;
}

var advocate: Advocate = { name: "Jeremy Likness", twitter: "@JeremyLikness", awesome: "High" };
// var advocate: Advocate = { name: "John Papa", twitter: "@John_Papa", awesome: "Unmeasurable" };
{{</highlight>}}

For all practical purposes, the `awesome` property is a string, but it‚Äôs been constrained to only three possible values. If I try to run the ‚ÄúJohn Papa‚Äù code, it will fail because ‚Äúunmeasurable‚Äù is not an allowed value. To build upon that idea, check this out:

{{<highlight TypeScript>}}
type AdvocateProperty = keyof Advocate;

const getProperty = (adv: Advocate, key: AdvocateProperty) => adv[key];
console.log(getProperty(advocate, "twitter"));
//console.log(getProperty(advocate, "linkedin"));
{{</highlight>}}

`AdvocateProperty` is also a string, but the list of potential values is taken from the type information for `Advocate`. Constraining values to known property names is useful when you implement functions like `getProperty` that allow you to fetch properties from an object based on their key (string) value. Using the special `keyof `statement, the possible values are now constrained to known properties on the type, so the attempt to fetch a key of ‚Äúlinkedin‚Äù will not compile. Imagine how much extra safety this provides for various library and framework implementations!

The last cool feature I‚Äôd like to highlight is type guards. Consider the following code:

{{<highlight TypeScript>}}
// explicit type guard
const isNumber = (inp: any): inp is number => {
    console.log(`inp: ${inp} typeof inp: ${typeof inp}`);
    return typeof inp === "number";
}

var test:any = 5;
console.log(test.toFixed(0)); // no intellisense
if (isNumber(test)) {
    console.log(test.toFixed(0)); // intellisense
}
{{</highlight>}}

Because ‚Äútest‚Äô is declared as type `any`, the IDE doesn‚Äôt provide hints or auto-completion when you reference it. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to show methods that could be part of any type, class, or function. However, the `isNumber` method has a type guard declared: `inp is number`. Because of this, the TypeScript engine knows that inside the scope of the `if` condition the type _must_ be `number`. It‚Äôs the only way it can pass the test! Therefore it provides auto-completion for numeric functions and properties in that scope. This is the same concept using an implicit type guard:

{{<highlight TypeScript>}}
var secret:any = "my secret";
console.log(secret.charAt(0)); // no intellisense
if (typeof secret === "string") { // implicit type guard
    console.log(secret.charAt(0)); // intellisense
}
{{</highlight>}}

In conclusion, I give special thanks to the organizers and attendees of the event. It was a great way to kick off 2018!
