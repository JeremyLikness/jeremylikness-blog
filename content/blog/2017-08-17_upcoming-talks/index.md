## June 8 - 10, 2021 DEVintersection Orlando

**[DEVintersection](https://www.devintersection.com)**

_Orlando, FL_ hybrid event (I will be virtual).

- [EF Core for Modern Data Access](https://www.devintersection.com/#!/session/EF%20Core%20for%20Modern%20Data%20Access/4684)

Take complete control over data access from .NET. The Entity Framework Core team has been hard at work in collaboration with the open-source community implementing the top requested features. The release of EF Core 5 brought many-to-many, table-per-type, filtered includes, split queries and many other major features. EF Core 6 is on track to match Dapper in performance benchmarks and provide even more flexibility with support for JSON columns, SQL temporal tables, migration bundles and compiled models. Join Jeremy on this tour of EF Core and learn how to use the latest features with hands-on demos featuring different providers from SQLite to Azure Cosmos DB.
