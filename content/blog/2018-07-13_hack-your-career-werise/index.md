In December of 2017 I received an invitation to return to speak at the [WeRise Technology Conference](https://werise.tech/), hosted by [Women who Code in Atlanta](https://www.womenwhocode.com/atl). I was extremely excited and pleased because I had a very positive experience <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [last year](https://github.com/JeremyLikness/docker-we-rise). I wanted to do a different style talk for this conference and decided instead of focusing on a technology, I would instead share some career advice based on my professional developer experience.

I am thankful the WeRise organizers were willing to invest in recording and publishing the presentations. You can view the full video of my presentation here‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve been coding professionally since 1994, have served in both individual contributor and manager roles. During that time I personally reviewed thousands of resumes and hired dozens of developers.

I have a much easier time now dealing with [impostor syndrome](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx) before talks than I did earlier in my career because I‚Äôve learned to focus more on the audience and what I can share than making it about me. My career talk was different from my typical sessions because it was a soft skills presentation and I wasn‚Äôt sure how it would be received. I was also very sensitive to the fact that the event is focused on women in technology, so it was important to me this message wasn‚Äôt received as a lecture or soap box but sincere sharing with a desire to help and drive dialog around topics people may disagree with or have different views based on their personal experiences.

Here is the full deck from my talk (PDF):

All of the images in the deck are pictures of me or that I have personally taken. It‚Äôs one of the rare opportunities to see me with hair. As I experienced the year before, the audience was warm and welcoming and reacted to the talk almost instantly.

I received some great feedback ‚Ä¶

My first ‚Äúreal‚Äù programming was using [6502 assembly](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/6502_Assembly) on a [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), and I‚Äôll never forget the language or the fun I had creating code on a 64 kilobyte machine. I still think the most fun I had as a developer was when [Silverlight] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight)was released. Although Silverlight is now, too, a platform for the history books, I won‚Äôt forget the exciting challenges I faced learning the platform inside and out to provide cutting edge line of business solutions. It should be no surprise I find a way to work it into every talk.

This was a nice tweet posted the day after the talk. In addition to her kind words, the screenshot summarizes my career hacking tips quite well.

I admit it can seem awkward for a speaker to post a lot of ‚Äúself-praising‚Äù tweets. This is really my equivalent of a ‚Äúwin wall.‚Äù If I‚Äôm ever insecure going into a talk, I remind myself first why I do it, and second what the feedback from other talks has been. I had no idea how this talk would be received, so the positive support and feedback is great inspiration for future talks.

Overall it was an incredible experience and I highly recommend this conference to anyone who is able to travel to the Atlanta area.
