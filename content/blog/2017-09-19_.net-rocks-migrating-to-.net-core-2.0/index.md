The latest version of Core has the vast majority of the base class libraries from the original framework implemented.

I talk about my open source project called <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [Sterling](https://github.com/JeremyLikness/SterlingNoSQL) that hails back from the Silverlight days as a NoSQL data store. And it [migrated fine](https://github.com/JeremyLikness/sterling-net-core)! The conversation dives into other aspects beyond being cross platform, including performance benefits and what new technologies are on the horizon that may be Core-only. Itâ€™s a great time to kick the tires on Core!
