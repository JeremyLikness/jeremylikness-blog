.NET Rocks Podcast

I talk about my open source project called [Sterling] (https://github.com/JeremyLikness/SterlingNoSQL)that hails back from the Silverlight days as a NoSQL data store. And it [migrated fine](https://github.com/JeremyLikness/sterling-net-core)! The conversation dives into other aspects beyond being cross platform, including performance benefits and what new technologies are on the horizon that may be Core-only. It’s a great time to kick the tires on Core!
