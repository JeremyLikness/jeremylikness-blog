Monday, May 13th, 2019 was the date we kicked off the inaugural [.NET South conference](https://dotnetsouth.tech). It was also the date I delivered a new talk, ‚ÄúManaging Data in the Cloud.‚Äù

The presentation features three case studies that illustrate different approaches to managing and accessing data. There is a flights database that traverses a graph of nodes and vertices to compute possible flight paths between two airports. The link shortening example highlights the entirely serverless application I run in production to create, use, and report on URLs. Finally, the Tailwind Traders application leverages microservices that include a Node.js app with a MongoDB backend and a .NET Core API on top of Azure SQL.

The presentation contains all the relevant links and walks through how to classify data, how each class of data translates to cloud services, and how apps are built to use the various options. The deck concludes with a look at a service designed to migrate your data from existing on-premises solutions to the cloud.

The repository dives even deeper. It contains links for the prerequisites to run the presentation. It includes step-by-step instructions for every demo. Finally, there are links to the hands-on learning modules and documentation for all the services covered.
