I was delighted when I discovered my [TechBash 2018](https://techbash.com) presentation would be live streamed over [Twitch](https://twitch.tv).

![Image of slide deck title](/blog/2018-10-08_say-yes-to-nosql-for.net-sql-developers/images/1.png)

The presentation includes an in-depth overview of NoSQL, including common NoSQL ‚Äúflavors‚Äù such as key/value pair, document, graph, and column-based databases. I then demonstrate how these databases are implemented using the fully managed [Azure CosmosDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction?utm_source=jeliknes&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=techbash18&WT.mc_id=techbash18-blog-jeliknes). The presentation includes demonstrations of several types of database, a dive into the portal to examine partition keys at work (and why they are important for partition-optimized queries) and lots of .NET and .NET Core source code.
