#### Is it possible to be an entrepreneur and an employee at the same time?

Recently I’ve read quite a few articles and blog posts that decry the golden handcuffs of corporate life and extend an alluring invitation to “be your own boss.” Just imagine how amazing it will be when your calendar is truly free of those annoying meetings, you get to set your own work hours and “getting a raise” simply means bringing in more sales. Work remotely, travel the world, and live where you want. Doesn’t it all sound exciting?

It did to me when I was in my roaring twenties and decided to embark on a new journey. Don’t worry, this isn’t _that_ article where I bitterly recount my painful failures and caution you to stay conservative and stop rocking the boat. It still holds that same allure even now, only my experience has opened me to a new possibility: that there are many paths to enlightenment and I’m not the best boss of me.

The term “entrepreneur” is fairly cut and dry: 
> Entrepreneur: one who organizes, manages, and assumes the risks of a business or enterprise>  — source: [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/entrepreneur](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/entrepreneur)

Although it is a clear definition for anyone who is self-employed, is it possible to bring an _entrepreneurial spirit_ into the workplace? Let me share a story …

#### The Backstory

In 1999 I was having serious issues. My daughter was on the way and I couldn’t even play basketball with my son because I could barely bend over to tie my shoes. I was popping buttons on 44&#34; slacks and every “diet” I tried seemed to fail. I convinced myself that I was one of those unfortunate people with a slow metabolism that would never be able to lose weight. Things were about to change.

Later that year, I was sitting in a law chair that literally groaned on my weight as my son drilled for football practice. They were at the opposite end of the field and I was bored, so I pulled out the copy of [Body for LIFE](https://amzn.to/2tULcZq) my wife gave me earlier but I refused to read (because I was _done_ with diets, right?). This book was different, however, in that it didn’t start with diet or exercise but focused on success stories and outlined the key to success: mindset. 

This was a new concept to me. I could change my mind? Was it really that simple? The decision was easy, the journey wasn’t. I lost 65 pounds and finished in the top 2000 for a competition that 1 million people entered. I got certified as a fitness trainer and a specialist in nutrition and started my own business. 

Like many people, I wanted to be my own boss and pursue my passion for fitness. So, inspired by the words, “Sometimes you have to jump and figure out how to make the parachute on the way down,” I promptly quit my job and started my own business.

What did I _really_ want? It can be summed in a few key goals:
> …to do what I am passionate about> …to have flexible hours > …to be able to work from home> …to travel when I wanted > …to earn enough income to support our family and family goals

OK, so how did I do?

#### Life Lessons

The first year was a lesson in minimalism. I earned around $10,000 USD that entire year, or a tiny fraction of what I was making in the corporate world. To keep the business going, I liquidated my 401k, sold the properties we owned and racked up credit card debt. I realized I had no clue what I was doing, so I invested heavily in business coaching aligned around my goals. 

And you know what? _It worked._

By my third year I was earning six figures of income through my business. Unfortunately, I was also almost six figures in debt getting there. Over that period, a lot of lessons were learned:

*   **Humility**. It’s not about me being the best, it’s about being the best me.
*   **Minimalism**. I’m far from a minimalist, but before almost losing everything I was certainly a materialist and this experience taught me a greater appreciation for the non-tangible things in life.
*   **Confidence**. I learned to be comfortable being me, whether selling my service or presenting.
*   **Courage**. Fear is something I doubt I’ll ever eliminate, but now I know experiencing it is a sign to move forward. 

About that time I received a call from the founder of a company I previously worked at. He successfully led the company to an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and cashed out for nearly a billion in stock. I call that success! He asked if I was interested in helping him start a new company, and I replied, “Yes!”

#### The Punchline

I jumped head first into the new start-up. At first, I imagined it would be possible to continue my fitness business “on the side” as I helped bootstrap this new company. Oh, was I wrong!

The first few months I worked “remote.” It was really “living remote, working up close.” It meant I lived in Florida and flew into the office on Sunday, worked 18 hour days during the week and flew back home for the weekend. To give you an idea of startup life if you’re not familiar with it, my first day the CEO drove me to a store and bought a desk. He then dropped me off in front of the lofts our office was in, handed me some keys, and said “We’re on the second floor. Find a good spot and set up your desk. I’ll see you later.”

It didn’t take long for me to recognize I was working so many hours my fitness business wasn’t going anywhere, so I sold my online properties and dissolved the business. I actually profited nicely from the sale despite it being shortly after the “dot-com crash” so there’s that.

It took me a bit longer to recognize I was working so many hours that my personal life was also not going anywhere. It was a strain on my wife and daughter (our son had since moved out) and despite me feeling like I was a hero, the reality was I would take frustration and stress home with me and became an unpleasant person to be around. 

Denouement
