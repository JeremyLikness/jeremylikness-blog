#### Learn how easy it is to build microservices leveraging JavaScript and Node.js with Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and Application Insights.

Recently I was invited to speak at the [Google Developer Group in Atlanta](https://www.meetup.com/gdg-atlanta/events/239234548/). I found it ironic that same night a local Azure meetup group hosted a talk about the Google cloud. This just demonstrates how the community is aligned around supporting and educating each other and focused on solutions over debates around “this is better than that.” I love the opportunity to learn about new technologies and share what I know with others.

Google Developer Group Atlanta Meetup



The format was two presentations and I learned about Android and Arduino from the first presenter. I then covered serverless Azure Functions with a focus on the support for JavaScript and Node.js.

As with previous talks, I recorded the demos and posted them to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrLikness). The full deck with embedded video is available here:

I really appreciated the opportunity and look forward to coming out again sometime in the future.
