This is the second and last part of a series of steps designed to teach TypeScript by refactoring a JavaScript application. Be sure to read and step through [part one](https://blog.jeremylikness.com/typescript-for-javascript-developers-by-refactoring-part-1-of-2-1c3f97115b1f) if you haven‚Äôt already! Here‚Äôs a sample of the code we‚Äôll end up with.

## 10. Simple Refactoring

To kick off the second half, I start with a simple refactoring. I add a `debugDelay` method to simplify messages I am logging for tracing purposes.

## 11. Interfaces

Interfaces start to take us into more advanced and unique features of TypeScript. Interfaces don‚Äôt exist in generated JavaScript code and help boost productivity during development. Unlike other languages, TypeScript doesn‚Äôt treat the interface name as a unique type, but the signature. Two differently named interfaces with the same set of properties and/or functions are the same interface. Learn how to define and apply an interface.

## 12. Recursive Print

The interface is extended to include an optional property. Create a generic function that takes any item that implements `ICanPrint` and recursively calls `print()` on the item and the function on its children (if they exist). A read-only property is implemented using a ‚Äúgetter‚Äù on the `ContactList` class, then the code is refactored to use the recursive print function.

## 13. Format the Print Output

A few helper functions format the print by making it possible to pass a property and output a label with its corresponding value. The code is refactored to use the new functions and a new defect appears; name is no longer printing and shows as `undefined`. Fortunately, TypeScript is ready to fix it in the next iteration.

## 14. Key Types to the Rescue

TypeScript supports a special convention `keyof` (called an ‚Äúindex type‚Äù) that will inspect the signature of a class or interface, then create a list of allowed string values based on that signature. In this step, a custom key type is created for properties of `IAmContact`. This immediately reveals the defect and provides an auto-completion suggestion to fix it.

## 15. Type Guards

Type guards are another extremely useful feature that help improve productivity and catch errors before the JavaScript is even compiled. They allow you to specify tests that determine the type of a variable and allow the compiler to understand the characteristics of the variable when the test succeeds. This enables auto-completion and catches errors based on accessing properties or methods that aren‚Äôt part of that type.

## 16. Strict Types

At the start of the project, ‚Äústrict types‚Äù was turned off to avoid several errors introduced after migrating the JavaScript app over. Enough refactoring has been done that this can get switched on without any errors. A new method is added that takes and age to compute ‚Äúyear born‚Äù ‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs not the point. It sets up the next step that has some truly powerful features to show.

## 17. Type Decorators

Decorators are one of the most powerful aspects of TypeScript. They enable aspect-oriented development. You can create a piece of functionality, or a ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù, and apply that behavior to code using attributes. If you‚Äôve done any [Angular](https://angular.io/) development, decorators are used extensively in the framework. See how to build and apply your own decorator in this step.

## 18. Compilation Targets

I love that TypeScript keeps me current with the latest JavaScript versions by keeping pace with updated specifications. I can use new language features, and they are translated to legacy JavaScript when I target old versions, or ‚Äúpassed through‚Äù when I am writing for modern browsers. See this in action!

## The End

That‚Äôs it for this series. I hope by using JavaScript as a starting point, I was able to convey:

* How it works in the TypeScript world
* The flexibility of TypeScript
* The benefits TypeScript brings including finding and auto-suggesting fixes for common defects _before your code reaches production_

I‚Äôm curious to hear your thoughts and feedback, so please feel comfortable sharing them in the comments below!
