The plan was in place. Every step of the day had been meticulously prepared. There was a clear vision in my mind of how each phase would unfold. I’d have a pleasant lunch and end it by signing an employment contract with my new company. I’d drive back to the office listening to loud 80&#39;s alternative music, swagger into the CEO’s office and dramatically deliver the bad news: “I’m out of here.” He’d respond with shock and dismay, ask me how much it would cost for me to stay, and shake his head with dismay when I responded with a firm, “Not enough.” I’d be escorted out immediately for security reasons and enjoy two weeks of “between jobs” vacation to reflect on my future.

I built most of the systems and software at the company and directly managed the full team of developers, report writers and database administrators. I prepared for “the day” by ensuring everything I did was documented and could be accomplished by someone else on my team. I identified a developer we’ll call “Samantha” who I was secretly training to take over my role and would recommend as my successor during my exit interview. I mulled over the change for a long time and had plenty of time to prepare.

I came in early as I always did and started counting down the hours and minutes until lunch. As I was waiting, Samantha came over and asked if we could chat.

“Sure, no problem. What’s up?”

“I hate to do this, but it’s not because of you. I really respect you and your leadership, but it’s time for me to move on.”

It sounded like boulders crashing when Samantha slapped the resignation letter on my desk. With trepidation (this _wasn’t_ how things were supposed to unfold) I crept into the CEO’s office.

“I’ve got some bad news. Samantha is leaving us.”

“No way.” (Denial) Me: “Yes, I’m afraid so.”

“Well, I never liked the work Samantha was doing any way. It’s good riddance.” (Anger. I remained silent.)

“This may actually be a good thing. We’re opening up head count!” (Bargaining)

(He skipped the sadness/despair phase)

“Thanks, let me know if anything else comes up.”

Samantha was escorted out and I headed to lunch. As expected: a brief drive, good food and conversation, a few signed documents, then back to the office.

I took a moment to reflect on my decision.

Almost four years earlier I was running my own business and working from home when the co-founder of a major software company I’d coded at before called me. He shared that he was starting a new company and asked if I’d like to come on board to own and drive technology. I would be the third employee and in on the “ground floor.” His past company went public and his shares were worth almost one billion. He would mentor me and teach me how to succeed big at the new venture.

The company _was_ growing and I did get to drive the technology. Unfortunately, four years later I was still running around in start-up mode working double shifts, sleeping overnight downtown, and losing points with my wife and children. I had to make a change, so I chose to leave the long hours in the office at a startup to work from home at a consulting firm that would give me automatic bonuses if I had to work overtime. Imagining my new life writing code in my pajamas, I snapped back to the present and headed to the office.

Things weren’t going as planned. I imagined a confident stride but ended up walking slowly. One hand held the resignation letter and the other was balled in a fist. Both hands were clammy and my mouth was suddenly dry. I stepped into the office feeling dizzy and forgot every word I planned on saying. The CEO spun around in his chair and said, “Yes?”

I dropped the letter. Picked it up. Pushed it forward. A weak, stuttering voice that sounded nothing like the booming voice of command I imagined earlier squawked out a faint, “Someone else is leaving.”

Really? _“Someone else is leaving?”_ I consoled myself by remembering that I at least was in his office and didn’t just push the note under the door and run.

“Who is it now?” (His eyes rapidly scanned the paper, then widened with disbelief.”

“No.”

Wait, what? No? They can’t say “No,” can they?

“You can’t quit.” And he threw the letter back at me.

“Uh, but I am quitting.”

“No, you can’t. I’m calling the chairman.”

“OK, but, um, I’m quitting.”

“No, you’re not. And if you are, I’m going to need six months of notice.”

“Just call the chairman.”

I slunk out of the room and tried to process what just happened. My phone buzzed. It was the new employer.

“Did you do it?”

“Um, kind of…”

“Kind of? You mean you’re not leaving?”

“I am, they just told me I couldn’t.”

“Well, that’s ridiculous. So, they want like three weeks instead of two?”

“Six months. That is, if I’m allowed to quit.”

“Of course you’re allowed. You _did_ just quit. Didn’t you?”

“I think so.”

The chairman flew down to talk to me and we all agreed I was, indeed, going. We mapped out how things would unfold. I would leave after two weeks but the company, fearing I had everything locked up in my head, asked me to commit to consult for them on demand as needed for the next six months. To make a short story boring, I ended up leaving after two weeks and despite everyone’s fears was only called a few times for random questions that came up. Ultimately it was the right decision (even if the company went on to sell for $1.5 billion, but that’s a different story). It remains the most interesting and awkward resignation I’ve experienced during my 25 years as a professional developer.
