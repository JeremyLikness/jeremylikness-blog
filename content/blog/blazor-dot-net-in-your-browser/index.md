My last speaking engagement of 2019 was during a webinar for the wonderful technology community in Nepal. I provided an introduction to Blazor and walked through some of its more powerful features including components, service registration, JavaScript interoperability and using existing .NET Standard Libraries. If you're new to Blazor, this is a one hour investment I'm confident you will benefit from.

The full presentation, including Q&A, is available at: <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> [Blazor: .NET in Your Browser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glU0SOfHEag):

As always, questions and feedback are welcome.
