In June of 2019 I presented a 45-minute session about WebAssembly at Refactr.Tech in Atlanta.

{{<customtwitter 1137041533625032704>}}

In this presentation I reviewed:

* asm.js
* WebAssembly
* Building WebAssembly with C using Emscripten
* How WebAssembly manages memory
* Creating WebAssembly apps with Go
* Compiling Rust to WebAssembly
* Building fullstack apps in C# using Blazor WebAssembly
