Earlier this year I was invited to speak at the [We Rise: Women in Tech](https://werise.tech/) conference. The conference wasnâ€™t just for women who code, but rather a celebration _of_ women who code. It was a great experience and I was delighted when <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i> [Alicia Carr](https://twitter.com/Fineblkwoman) tracked me down at [Connect.Tech 2017](/connect-tech-2017-node-js-and-typescript-8419b0e4d689) for an interview about my thoughts and experiences there.
