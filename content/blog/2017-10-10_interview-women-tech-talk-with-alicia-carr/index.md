#### Sharing my experiences at the We Rise: Women who Code conference in Atlanta, GA and discussing diversity and inclusion in the modern development world.

Earlier this year I was invited to speak at the [We Rise: Women in Tech](https://werise.tech/) conference. The conference wasn’t just for women who code, but rather a celebration _of_ women who code. It was a great experience and I was delighted when [Alicia Carr](https://twitter.com/Fineblkwoman) tracked me down at [Connect.Tech 2017](https://blog.jeremylikness.com/connect-tech-2017-node-js-and-typescript-8419b0e4d689) for an interview about my thoughts and experiences there.
