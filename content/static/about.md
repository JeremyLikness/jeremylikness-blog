## About

My name is Jeremy Likness. I've been writing code for a _long time_... over 30 years! I am a developer for life.

My current mission is to **empower developers to be their best.** I do this several ways: connecting with community (both online and offline), creating and curating great content, and working directly with engineers. Keep up with my curated content by [following me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeremylikness). The content I create is mostly hosted here, on this blog!

> If you're curious, I maintain this blog using markdown in a <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub repository. When I check in the code, my free [Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/?view=azure-devops&utm_source=jeliknes&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=aboutme&WT.mc_id=aboutme-blog-jeliknes) account uses the [Hugo generator](https://gohugo.io) to produce static files that are deployed to [Azure Storage Static Websites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website?utm_source=jeliknes&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=aboutme&WT.mc_id=aboutme-blog-jeliknes).

Some random facts about me:

* I wrote my first program in BASIC on a TI-99/4A in 1982.
* My first professional development job was writing software for AS/400 midrange machines using RPG in 1994.
* I've written and co-authored [several books](https://amzn.to/2IkBCqq).
* I was diagnosed with [young onset Parkinson's Disease](https://www.strengthwithparkinsons.com/) in March 2020 at the age of 45.
* I'm a devout follower of Jesus Christ.
* I used to be a certified fitness trainer and specialist in performance nutrition and owned my own [online business](http://web.archive.org/web/20010629182818/http://www.peakphysiques.com/).
* One of my many jobs was working in a pool hall and I've been a fan of 9-ball and One Pocket for decades now.

Welcome and enjoy!
